# Aarohee Sharma - Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, education, projects, and achievements as a B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Guwahati (IIITG). The website is designed with a nature-inspired theme, featuring a misty forest background, an accordion navigation menu, and interactive elements like a green leaf mouse trail.

## Technologies Used

## Installation
To run this portfolio website locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   cd Personal-Portfolio-Website
   ```

3. **Open the Website**
   - Open `portfolio.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
   - Ensure the `background.jpg` file is in the same directory as `portfolio.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.

4. **Verify Dependencies**
   - No external server is required; the site runs statically.
   - Internet access is needed for Google Fonts and the wood texture pattern (if not cached locally).

## Usage
